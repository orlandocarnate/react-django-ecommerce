# E-Commerce Backend
Backend using Django and Django Rest Framework

## Installation
* [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
* [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
* [Django CORS Headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) A Django App that adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses. This allows in-browser requests to your Django application from other origins.

## Serializing Product Data
Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types. Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.

`serializers.py`
```
from rest_framework import serializers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Product

class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = '__all__'
```
